#Branching Strategies

Three types of branch
1. Default, sometime referred as master, or sometime dev_branch, test_branch, prod_branch

2. Feature branch

3. Release branch

Ideal scenario:
Developer create a feature branch based off the default. He/She will then make their changes and then push it to 
their branch. In my organization, then jenkins used to trigger that build.

Once the build isnsuccessful, the then merge their feature branch to the default branch.

Once all developers completed their code changes and merge their feature branch to the default, we then lock the default branch and then create a release branch.

Once that release branch is complete, we then lock the release, old default and then create a next set of default branch.

The next set willl be based off pom.xml file version

For example, if the initial default branch is springboot-dev-0.1.0 the next default will be 0.1.1 and the release branch will be 0.1.0-RELEASE.
